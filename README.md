# Welcome to the Next.js Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository is my starting point for diving into Next.js, a powerful framework built on React that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and a suite of other modern web development features. This README outlines the key components and concepts I will explore through the provided materials and code examples.

## What I'll Learn

### Key Concepts
- **Compiler**: I will understand how to transform and minify JavaScript code, preparing it for production.
- **CLI**: I will learn to utilize the Next.js command line interface to effectively build and start applications.
- **Node.js Runtime**: I will gain insights into the execution environment for JavaScript code, enabling server-side execution.

### Full-Stack Development
- I will master the art of building applications that seamlessly handle both the frontend and backend using Next.js.

### Rendering Techniques
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: I will enhance SEO and improve load times by rendering pages on the server before they reach the browser.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: I will learn to generate static pages at build time, which enhances performance and reliability.

### Advanced Topics
- I will dive deeper into how Next.js interacts with the backend using Node.js and explore how the client-server model operates within a full-stack environment.
