## Setting Up `React Email`
To begin, we need to set up React Email in our project manually. Follow these steps:


1. **Install React Email and its components:**


   ```bash
   npm install react-email @react-email/components
   ```

2. **Add the development script to `package.json`:**


   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "preview-email": "email dev"
     }
   }
   ```
   
   > This script allows you to start a development server for previewing your email templates by running npm run preview-email. This will launch a local server where you can see changes to your email templates in real-time as you develop them.
  

## Creating an Email Template

Create a new folder called `emails` and inside it, create a file named `welcome.tsx` with the following content:
	
```
const WelcomeTemplate = () => {
    return (
        <Html>
            <Preview>Welcome to Our Service</Preview>
            <Body style={styles.body}>
                <Container style={styles.container}>
                    <div style={styles.header}>
                        <Heading style={styles.headerText}>
                            Welcome to Our Service!
                        </Heading>
                    </div>
                    <div style={styles.main}>
                        <Text>Dear User,</Text>
                        <Text>

                    </div>
                </Container>
            </Body>
        </Html>
    );
};
```


### Styling Emails
To style your emails, you can use inline styles or CSS-in-JS like *Tailwind*. 

>Inline styles are recommended for better compatibility across different email clients.

```
const styles = {
  container: { padding: "20px", fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif" },
  header: { color: "#333" },
  link: { color: "#007bff" }
};

const WelcomeEmail = () => (
  <Email>
    <div style={styles.container}>
      <h1 style={styles.header}>Welcome to Our Service!</h1>
      <p>We're excited to have you on board.</p>
      <a href="https://yourwebsite.com" style={styles.link}>Get Started</a>
    </div>
  </Email>
);
```

## Previewing Emails

- Run the development server: `npm run preview-email`;
- **See changes live**: open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your email template.


## Service Integration

`React Email` works with various other email services, including:

- Nodemailer
- SendGrid
- Postmark
- AWS SES
- MailerSend
- Plunk
- **Resend**


>**Note:** Resend was built by the same team that created React Email, making it our recommended service for sending emails.


### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:

- Visit [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- Create an API key
- Verify your domain


### Installation

```
npm install resend
```

### Sending an Email
In the `send-email` directory, create `route.tsx` with the following content:

```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import WelcomeTemplate from '../../../emails/welcome';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

async function sendEmail() {
    await resend.emails.send({
        from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
        to: 'my_email@ga.co',
        subject: 'Hello World',
        react: <WelcomeTemplate />,
    });

    return NextResponse.json({});
}

export { sendEmail as POST };
```
